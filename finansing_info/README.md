# To read

# To watch
* how the economic machine works by Ray Dalio

# how to know if the crisis is close 
* check duration of the us business cycle
* ISM manufacturing(if less 50 points -> manufacturinng slowing down)
* U.S. Treasury yield curve - when 3 month bonds are more profitable than 10 years one -> recession is comming
* Leading economic indicators are statistics that precede economic events. They predict the next phase of the business cycle. That becomes critical when the economy is either coming out of a recession or heading into one.
* When interest rates rise, you know the economy will slow down soon. It costs more to take out a loan, making everyone buy less.
* Falling and low interest rates create liquidity for businesses and consumers. That means money is cheap, and both are more likely to buy as soon as the economy improves.

# What is going to be during recession/crisis
* shares are cheaper
* raw resources are cheaper(less to be produced)
* corporate bonds are cheaper(emitter may not be able to guarantee payments)
* bankruptcies of companies 
* players are going to save capital by moving it in cash, currencies(swiss frank, japan jen), treasury bonds, gold
* polish zloty may slow down
* possible small pricing down for real estate
* euro may slow down
* swiss frank may go up

# Portfolio example
* security cushion(mid)  
 deposits
 10-year treasury bonds(inflation is indexed, )
* longterm targets(bid)  
 real estate  
 market portfolio(treasure bonds, shares, indexed detailed bonds, deposits, raws, gold, corporate bonds)
* speculation(small)  
 contracts(like wig20)

# What to do before crisis:
* build portfolio:  
  gold(bars, bullion coins krugerrand, Vienna Philharmonic, australian kenguru, no collection coins, no etf investment)
  bonds indexed by inflation
  swiss frank / japan jen (small) 

* Treasure bonds vs bond funds  
- funds cannot buy detailed bonds  
- funds are locating capital in papers emitted by treasury of gov., prices on those bonds are non-fixed
- funds are taking money for their work
* detailed bonds  
- prices are growing each day  
- you have a system to check their price  
- no fee for managing them  
* risk about bonds   
 - emitter may meet bankruptcy
 - anyway deposit is still more risky then treasury bonds
 
 * treasury bonds  
  - you can sold them before 10 or whatever years(but tax on income and fee for early sold out, 2 pln for one bond)
  * 10 years example: EDO929 (Emerytalne Dziesiecioletnie Oszczednosciow month year)  
  - capitalization once a year  
  - first year ~2.7%, after that inflation + 1.5%
  - too high inflation may possibly lead to income smaller than inflation
    
  
  * types of bonds:    
  ROD  (Rodzinne dwunastoletnie oszczędnościowe obligacje skarbowe)   
  ROS  (Rodzinne sześcioletnie oszczędnościowe obligacje skarbowe)*

  OTS  (Trzymiesięczne oszczędnościowe obligacje skarbowe o oprocentowaniu stałym)  

 
### How don't spend money on some bullshit
* if you can't control you spending on some category -> start using weekly budgeting
* i.e. split the amount you want in one month per day. And spend not more than this amount. 


### Financies and relationship

* find you financial goals
* common budget with small private "pockets"
* spend in accordance with your financial state
* no loans

### ETF
* Exchange traded fund. An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value,although deviations can occasionally occur. Most ETFs track an index, such as a stock index or bond index. ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features.
* ETFs generally provide the easy diversification, low expense ratios, and tax efficiency of index funds, while still maintaining all the features of ordinary stock, such as limit orders, short selling, and options. Because ETFs can be economically acquired, held, and disposed of, some investors invest in ETF shares as a long-term investment for asset allocation purposes, while other investors trade ETF shares frequently to hedge risk over short periods or implement market timing investment strategies.
* Among the advantages of ETFs are the following:
    * Lower costs: ETFs generally have lower costs than other investment products because most ETFs are not actively managed and because ETFs are insulated from the costs of having to buy and sell securities to accommodate shareholder purchases and redemptions. ETFs typically have lower marketing, distribution and accounting expenses, and most ETFs do not have 12b-1 fees.
    * Buying and selling flexibility: ETFs can be bought and sold at current market prices at any time during the trading day, unlike mutual funds and unit investment trusts, which can only be traded at the end of the trading day. As publicly traded securities, their shares can be purchased on margin and sold short, enabling the use of hedging strategies, and traded using stop orders and limit orders, which allow investors to specify the price points at which they are willing to trade.
    * Tax efficiency: ETFs generally generate relatively low capital gains, because they typically have low turnover of their portfolio securities. While this is an advantage they share with other index fuCzeki, weksle, listy zastawne, bony pieniężne, obligacje, itd… Rodzajów instrumentów dłużnych jest cała masa, ale na pewno nie będę zawracał Wam głowy ich opisywaniem. Warto jednak zapamiętać, że łączy je podstawowa cecha: są to papiery wartościowe opiewające na wierzytelności. Innymi słowy: wystawca papieru wartościowego ma do spłacenia jakiś dług względem posiadacza tego papieru. W tym artykule skupimy się na obligacjach, bo to one zajmują najwięcej miejsca w portfelach funduszy dłużnych.nds, their tax efficiency is further enhanced because they do not have to sell securities to meet investor redemptions.
    * Market exposure and diversification: ETFs provide an economical way to rebalance portfolio allocations and to "equitize" cash by investing it quickly. An index ETF inherently provides diversification across an entire index. ETFs offer exposure to a diverse variety of markets, including broad-based indices, broad-based international and country-specific indices, industry sector-specific indices, bond indices, and commodities.
    * Transparency: ETFs, whether index funds or actively managed, have transparent portfolios and are priced at frequent intervals throughout the trading day.
* to buy etf need to have an account in broker company
* can buy/sell at any time of the day (normal funds only at the end of the day)
* etc depends from fund index
* price: each time you are buying or selling -> need to pay fee, need to pay some fee on difference between buy and sell(bid ask spread), but those payments are lower(in comparison with normal funds). Good way is to invest a lot, and make operations rarely. 
* indeces are different, e.g. mWIG40 vs mWIG40TR 
* there is intraday pricing - price during whole trading session(day)
* dividends are moved to user account
* one way to inherit index - buy shares that are in index(physical inheritance)
* if not possible, synthetical interitance is used(etf from one branch is exchanging the return from its branch(japan shares) on return from another branch(gold), additional fee is added ) - quite risky
* the big broker Authorised Participant is taking care about ETF to inherit index properly


### Financing for children
* Games like monopoly, Catan, Power Grip, Splendlor
* pocket money - not on regular basis or small amount on regular basis( but instead no candies)
* split money on three groups - currents spendings, some big purchase, helping others
