# SOLID design principles
* Single Responsibility Principle - a class should ave only one single responsibility
* Open Closed Principle - entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
* Liskov Substitution Principle - objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering program correctness
* Interface Segregation Principle - many client-specific interfaces better than one general-purpose interface
* Dependency Inversion Principle - dependencies should be abstract rather than concrete
