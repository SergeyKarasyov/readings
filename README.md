 It's Not All About Me: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone 
 
## Identifying the needs
* Studies of personality(Myers Briggs Type Indicator, Five Factor Model, The personality Discernment Instrument) identify that about 50% of the population are people oriented. These are people who ask you about your day and family, wait for answer and care about it. 
* it is possible that how you express your feeling is not exactly what you are feeling

### Technique 1: establishing artificial time constraints
* may feel awkward if somebody starts to talk to you at the bar, airport, library. There may be discomfort as you don't know when or if it will end. To have a good rapport it is better to let other person know that there is an end in sight.
* themes better to be 'nonthreatening' and based on your life
* most human beings assess new situations and people for threat before anything else.
* time constraint -> show that you are done and ready to leave, that make person lower the threat level.
* from the salad example
```
say "I am about to leave"
some more questions
nonverbal matching gesture - use smartphone if the another person uses it too. 
```
# Technique 2: Accomodating Nonverbals
* getting info about mood(character) non-verbally - photo, look, behaviour. 
* Smiling is the number one nonverbal techinique.
* other important gestures - slight head tilt, lower chin angle

# Technique 3: Slower rate of speech
* when person speaks slowly and clearly they tend to sound more credible than those who speak quickly.
* rate of speech depends on many factors besides genetics and biology. Important factor is degree of extroversion
* speak slower when having a dialogue and you will not come accross as the "bad used car salesman"

# Technique 4: Sympathy or Assistance Theme
* when request for assistance is simple, of limited duration, non-threatening, we are more inclined to accomodate the request.As human beings we are biologically conditioned to accomodate requests for assistance. 
* for the purpose of the quick rapport, requests should be light
* based on an individual's life experience the techniques will be more or less effective.
* do not show that you have romantic motives
* need to say that you 
* are doing somethin special for you wife(not only married but think a great deal about her relationship)
* use third party reference that is not too personal, the topic is also not about you
* conversationalists have patience and wait for right opportunity to capitalize on opportunities that are natural and not ones that are forced.
* at first do not face body to person at first

# Technique 5: Ego suspension
* suspending smbd's ego is hard(smbd made a false statement and you didn't correct him)
* suspending our individual ego is hard
* remember about you objective, not how good you are
* self-centeredness is genetically coded in us , because without it our ancestors would not have survived.
* those who allow others to talk without taking their own turn are best conversationalist. 

# Technique 6: Validate others
* you want to be accepted and liked
* parents are continually reinforcing that there is a right and wrong way.  This is way of validation.
* three types of validation(better to be used together): 
   * validation technique 1: listening. It releases dopamine to the pleasure brain centers(same as drinking alcohol, taking risks, eating a lot of chocolate). If you are asked a question -> bounce it back, and person being validated will continue talking. Put entire focus on another person. When we aren't anxious to tell our own story, we also tend ot listen and hear better.
   * validation technique 2: Thoughtfulness(being involded in smbd needs). Put interests 
   of other person above yours. Have always chewing gum, hand sanitizer, candy and propose to partner before using it.
   * validation technique 3: Validate thoughts and opinions. We are self-centered. Validating thoughts of others is very powerful, but difficult because 'think like we do'. Good to make invidual to come up with your idea. Make the decision be theirs, not "yours". E.g. instead of saying "we don't need this" tell "a good idea, i hadn't thought of. i see the merit of it, let me come up with a few ideas for you to choose from". People would not be in defensive position, but rather open to your propositions. "Win-win" situation, implementation of one or another my choice via validation of someone's ideas.

# Technique 7: Ask .. How? When? Why?
* Open ended questions do not require a simple yes or no.   
Example:
```
- seems that I have an expert here
- no, i am not, just have some experience
- please tell me about your experience
- ...
- why?
- ...
- what was it like when you started?
- ...
```
* There are more techniques associated with asking "how, when, why":
   * minimal encouragers (head nodes, verbal confirmation)
   * reflective questions (restate the statement of partner as a question, most people genetically wired to be responsive. better to be used instead of arguing(listen and propose another ideas))
   * emotional labeling(powerful with person displaying a great deal of emotions((other techniques may be not effective in such a case)). strestfull day huh?
   * paraphrasing (so please correct me where I am wrong....). People have gotten so used to people not giving them their full attention.
   * pauses(1. break in a conversation to think about what you want to say, 2. create a slightly awkward silence that hopefully the other person will fill with his content(once it is done start: how? when?why?))
   * summarize(help you to remember the content of conversation, eliminate confusion on commitments made and favors asked)
# Technique 8: Quid pro quo(something for something)
 * good for some introverts or guarded/ or when person looks like "i spoke too much"(kinda vulnurable)
 * third party reference is a good starter. mention smth not about you or other person. "I am in the market for smth new. Wondering about thoughts of you"
 * with introverts inject some info about you each 15 minutes
 * but focus always on the other person, not you
# Technique 9: gift fiving(reciprocal(two-way) altruism)
* when somebody gives you a favor you most likely want to reciprocate with gratitude. 
* altruism is in our genes (hunter that shared, were given food even when were unsuccessful or ill)
* giving a "focus" is also a gift, people may unawarely gift this gift back with talking to you
* share hand sanitizer or mints, and if person will even decline he or she will want to reciprocate

# Technique 10: Manage our expectations
* every conversation has an agenda(objective, outcome). Sometimes it is to sell used car, sometimes it is to share a secret, sometimes make another person feel better
* manage expectation: instead of having yes or no, think aobut person as a friend you are about to provide an opportunity

# Summary: 
* Establishing artificial time constraints. Allow the person being targeted to feel that there is an end in sight
* Accommodating nonverbals. Ensure that both your body language as well as your voice is non-threatening
* Slower rate of speec. Don't oversell and talk too fast. You loose credibility quickly and come on too strong and threatening. 
* Sympathy or assistance theme. Human beings are genetically coded to provide assistance and help. It also appeals to their ego that they may know more than you. 
* Ego suspension. Most likely the hardest technique but without a doubt the most effective. Don't build yourself up, build someone else up and you will have string rapport. 
* Validate others. Human beings crave being connected and accepted. Validation feeds this need and few give it. Be the great validator and have instant, great rapport. 
* Ask... How? When? Why? When you want to dig deep and make a connection there is no better or safer way than asking these questions. They will tell you what they are willing to talk about. 
* Connect with quid pro quo. Some people are just more guarder than others. Allow them to feel comfortable by giving a little about you. Don't overdo it.
* Gift giving(reciprocal altruism). Human beings are genetically coded to reciprocate gifts given. Give a gift, either intangible or material, and seek a conversation and rapport in return. 
* Managing expectation. Avoid both dissapointment as well as the look ofg bad salesman by ensuring that your methods are focused on benefitting the targeted individual and not you. Ultimetely you will win, but your mindset need to focus on them.
