# Why investment funds
* Investment fund vs exchange/share/stock market
 Media says: "Investment fund's managers are not outperforming share markets, but still require some refund for their job.". That is not fully true.
* Investment Funds may invest in
 - shares
 - bonds
 - real estate
 * When you are investing in shares you have to choose between hundreds of companies. Some shares are growing in price, others are declining. Some companies are undergoing management board change or restructuration. It is hard to choose between them. We need some indexes to understand the tendencies on the market.
 * Stock market index is showing the tendencies on the market. If the companies stock is raised in price (or fall) is the same as for market index -> it is said that company in line with the stock index.
 * one huge problem in investment -> emotions
 
 # What is investment
 * Why to invest via investment funds:  
   deposits in banks are providing too low income  
   investments in the stock market require too much time, energy, etc  
   * good idea: collect each coin you get as a change, at the end of the year you would have some amount of money(that in otherwise would be spent on some bullshit)
 
 # Risks 
 * inflation is always present
 * capitalization of interest - is the addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of your loan.
 * Deposit_account - kinda "safe" way to accumulate some income from your money
 * the higher is possible income, the higher is a possible risk
 * Compound annual growth rate CAGR  
 CAGR=(final amount/starting amount)^(1/years) -1
 * Polish index WIG(Warszawski Indeks Gieldowy)
 * Gielda Papierow Wartosciowych - GPW
 * while owning stock there are two way to get income 1) change of the price 2) dividend
 * in long term case bonds are providing smaller income in comparison with shares(Polish case)
 * bonds are good because of inflation 
 * the longer is an investment the less risk is present(don't fully agree)
 * when investigating different funds we need to have medium income size(throughout all time + deviation). For bonds, both medium income and deviation are smaller than ones for shares.
 * usually funds are publishing rates of return for periods of the calendar year(1 Jan - 31 Dec)
 * it is possible to invest at one time or regularly.  
 * diversification: invest in shares(better income -> higher risk) and bonds(lower-income -> lower risk)

 * value cost averaging - Value averaging (VA), also known as dollar value averaging (DVA), is a technique for adding to an investment portfolio. With the method, investors add to (or withdraw from) their portfolios in such a way that the portfolio balance reaches a predetermined monthly or quarterly target, regardless of market fluctuations. E.g. you said that portfolio should cost 100 USD more each month. You may invest those 100USD each month or if shares price is rising you may only add the required amount to 100 USD, or even withdraw if the income at that month was bigger than 100USD. 
 * cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy to reduce the impact of volatility on large purchases of financial assets such as equities. Dollar-cost averaging is also called the constant dollar plan (in the US), Each time you are investing the same amount of money. 
 
 # How not to loose during declines on market
 * if shares are loosing 15-20%m you will need to get somehow 17-33 % of the initial cost. That is toleration line, more losses -> go out from this market. 
 * it is emotionally hard to close your participation in investment when toleration level is achieved. 
 * When moving the capital from share market we need to allocate it in some deposits or bonds. 
 * come again to this investment when falling is finished and shares are becoming more expensive(10% higher after the previous measurement).
 * the previous algorithm will not work with same numbers for bonds
 
 
 # Source of money for investment
 * never use money from credits or credit cards for some risky investments(even if credit cost is lower then possible income)
 * use money from your income(only the part you can afford to risk with)
 * interesting experiment: fat birds and skinny birds. Fat birds are making less risky decisions when choosing between more-food-risky and less-food-not-risky. Skinny birds were doing vice-verse. 
 
 # How much does it cost
 * investment policies proposed by Insurance company are shitty solutions, as those companies are requiring too many fees. 
 * Investment funds feed:  
 - commissions for the purchase or redemption of units  
 for buying new share it is necessary to pay ~3-5% as a fee 
 for buying new bonds ~2%  
 the redemption fee is not popular and it is lowering with each year, not more than 3%  
 those fees may be decreased if to buy a big amount of actives at once  
 there are "platforms" where no purchase or redemption fee (e.g. bossafund.pl)  
 - management fee  
 higher if investment policy is aggressive  
 usually 3.5 % yearly  
 is taken each day(i.e. 3.5%/365)  
 in long term investment, it is better to have this fee as low as possible
 is taken from the full fund  
 - performance fee  
 optional  
 may be 20% from income  
 is kind of marketing, you may think that fund management is sure about the performance   
 a fee is taken if a share price has risen at least on inflation level, or risen more than wig index  
 * investment funds have well-defined fees
 * check that liquidation fee is ok(not 90% of your actives) 
 
 # Funds
 * is an institution where people pay money  that is allocated in assets(shares, bonds, treasury notes, real estate, covered bond), in return receiving assets
 * assets may be -only part of asset or certificates, i.e. whole asset. 
 * funds may be closed(FIO) or open(SFIO), special open(FIZ)
 * there is a limited amount of certificates(may be increased via imitation)
 * in open funds if you buy an asset you cannot sell to anybody except fund. 
 * in closed funds certificates can be sold once per some period, 
 * if you want to sell certificate earlier(then time announced by fund) need to sell it to another investor
 * open funds are more comfortable
 * jednostki uczestnictwa(don't know how it is in English) may be called A, B, C, D. They differ by fees
 * An umbrella fund is a collective investment scheme that exists as a single legal entity but has several distinct sub-funds which, in effect, are traded as individual investment funds. You could move money between subfunds. 
 * Some funds are investing in assets of other funds
 * in Poland only TFI(towarzystwo funduszy inwestycyjnych) cam create a new fund.
 * in Poland funds are usually belonging to some big financial corporations
 * accounting of fund is performed by a separate institution called depozytariuz(may be Krajowy Depozyt Papierow Wartosciowych
 * agent transferowy calculates the amount of shares we have(he is in charge of purchasing, sell of shares )
 * distributors are an institution where we can purchase assets(banks, brokers)
 
 # Shares, bonds, real estate
 * Funds can be:  
 - share fund  
 - mixed fund  
 - bond fund   
 - money markets  
 * if 2/3 of the fund are papers  of some country it is called national(otherwise it is called foreign)
 * share funds container >51% of shares in their portfolio. More shares it has -> it is more unstable 
* if share fund is specialized on some sort of shares(shares of real estate developers) -> they are unstable 
 * you need to know in what markets the current fund is investing. It is available in "Key info for investors" doc.
 * there are index funds, they are investing in companies that are listed in some index, they should be cheaper as management cost is theoretically absent. 
 
 # bonds
 * they may be risky. Example SEB2(treasure bonds open fund) invested in Russian companies bonds(the name is about national bonds, while KII gives a chance to invest in company bonds)
 * not all treasury bonds are stable: Russia, Mexico, Argentina
 * Corporate bonds are risky(big companies less, small companies more)
 
 
 # other funds
  * mixed funds shares are 30%-70%, check KII
  * currency funds and money markets invest in treasure notes, currency, deposit certificates, bank deposits
  
  #
  * calculate the percentage of shares in the portfolio according to American authors = 100 - Age (don't fully agree)
  
  # How to choose funds: 
  * invest in most stable one, not the best at the moment.
  * new funds are risky
  * very old funds, may change teams and management, hence old results may not be repeated. 
  * big funds(and old) are not so changeable, to small funds may have some shitty assets that may kill it, the best funds are medium
  * You may choose more than one fund
  
  
  
 
# Pay taxes
 * 19 % tax on income(zryczałtowany podatek dochodowy aka podatek Belki )
 * it is better to invest in umbrella funds. In case if we get 1000 pln income from bonds and lost 2000 pln on shares, you still need to pay tax on income. 
 
 
 
 # Possible problems: payments are not allowed
 * selling of shares, estates may be done once a day or at least once a week. 
 * sometimes funds may stop taking payments from old and new investors(it has already some level of assets and managers don't want it to be increased, or some other reasons.)
 
 # Possible problems: cannot sell your shares
 * may be if in 2 weeks you want to sell more than 10%
   * maybe till 2 months
   * may be caused by the trend on market(everybody wants to sell this asset)
 
 # Changes in funds:
 * are usually published
 * are started to work after 3 month
 * fund may be  closed, or funds may be merged
